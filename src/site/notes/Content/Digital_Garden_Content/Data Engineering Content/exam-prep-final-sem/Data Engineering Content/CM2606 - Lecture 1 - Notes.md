## What is data engineering?

>[!Definition]
>It refers to the process of developing pipelines and infrastructures to handle data flows and intakes such that it is properly optimized and reaches its designated location in an optimized time period. Furthermore, data engineering includes report generation, etc

Some of the key components in data engineering include:

- Security Implementations
- Data Monitoring
- Storage Management
- Processing Data
- Maintaining Pipelines

Some of the biggest challenges faced by data engineers include how they are to accumulate data from multiple sources while moving and storing it in a secure and optimized fashion, hence making data engineering include the same functionalities as a Devops engineer, check the [[Content/Digital_Garden_Content/Data Engineering Content/Machine Learning Operations\|Machine Learning Operations]] note.
## What is big data?

>[!Definition]
>Big data refers to large data sets that are meant to be computationally processed due to how vast and big it is. Its domains vary from healthcare to business growth management, etc

Some solutions in big data include:

- Retail
- Transport
- Banking and Finance
- Tele-communications
- Healthcare

In data engineering, one of the most common manners of implementing and staging solutions as such is through the use of Amazon Web Services (**AWS**). It is a platform that offers services that provide users access to a series of virtual and cloud based resources and tools. Some use cases that actively utilize these services include:

- Netflix
- Facebook
- Instagram

## What is a data eco-system?

>[!Definition]
>A data eco-system is basically a network of interconnected components that vary from individuals to processes and technologies. The interconnected resources are meant to provide insights into how the system is running

In an organization, an eco-system refers to:

- **How the data is captured stored and processed**
- **How the captured data is used to generate insights into the system**
- **How the stakeholders are to act on the generated insights**

What makes eco-systems optimal for businesses is the fact that it is unaffected by the external world and is solely built to manage the businesses systems. Furthermore, it is scalable and easy to add components to. The components of a data eco-system include:

- **Data Capture**: E-commerce Sites, Web Applications, Social Media Applications, etc
- **Storage**: Databases, Data warehouses and Data lakes
- **Process/Insight Generation**: Sentiment Analysis, Trend Analysis, Performance analysis
- **Actions**: Strategic/ Operation business decision making
