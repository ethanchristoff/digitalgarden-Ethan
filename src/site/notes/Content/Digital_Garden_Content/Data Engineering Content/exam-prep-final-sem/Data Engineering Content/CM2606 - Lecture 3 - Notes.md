## ACID Properties of a Database

>[!Definition]
>ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability. These are each standards a database must achieve in order to be considered as an optimal storage medium for a business

- **Atomicity** - This property states that a transaction is a single, indivisible unit of work that cannot be split into smaller functions. Furthermore, it ensures that a transaction made within a database is always complete and not partially complete. If a transaction were only to make a portion of its content reach its destination it is to be considered as a failed transaction 
- **Consistency** - Any transaction made within one state in the database is to remain the same in another by adhering to rules and constraints. In other words, when a transaction in a database is made it must be the same from the initial state to the goal state by complying with constraints, etc
- **Isolation** - Each transaction made within the database is to be independant of another transaction as they must not interfere with each other. In other words, concurrent transactions are not to interfere with each other, hence maintaining a level of abstraction where they are invisible to each other
- **Durability** - Once a transaction is made, its changes are permanent in order to ensure that in the case of a power outage or failure the data retained in each end of a transaction is to remain the same

To conclude, **Atomicity** ensures that transactions are always complete and not partially complete, **Consistency** ensures that the initial states and goal state of a transaction remain the same by adhering to rules and constraints, **Isolation** ensures that concurrent transactions are always independant of each other and do not interfere and **Durability** states that whatever transaction made in the database makes permanent changes

## Data Storage Systems

>[!Definition]
>Mediums in which data is physically stored on such that the data accessed through them may be done so at different speeds and rates (each storage medium caters to a different purpose through variated speeds)

- **HDD's, SSD's** - Cost effective, scalable and ideal for local access
- **Network Attached Storage (NAS)** - Centralized storage in a network, ideal for shared access
- **Storage Area Network (SAN)** - Block level data access that provide a network of data storage nodes, each node is accessible by a different level
- **Big Data Distributed Storage** - Distributed and fault tolerant storage devices developed to handle and manage big data

## Data Ingestion Architecture 

>[!Definition]
>A data ingestion architecture is a design/blueprint laid out to define an ETL workflow. It specifies how the data is taken in, processed and loaded onto its target destination. Besides that, its a framework referred to in the creation of a system

![Pasted image 20250413123510.png](/img/user/pngs/Pasted%20image%2020250413123510.png)

In the image above, the following features may be noted:

- **Ingestion Flow** - Here data is collected from multiple sources and then loaded into a data lake (a place where the data is stored)
- **ETL Flow** - Extraction, transforming and loading, here data is processed and loaded into a warehouse while concurrently serving the unprocessed data into a database that may have users access it through API's
- **BI/Reporting** - Business intelligence and reporting, here there are analytics and reports made of the data processed and loaded into the warehouse such that important details may be denoted from it (e.g. trends)
- **Data Science Modelling/ Further processing** - Some of the processed data or unprocessed data may be fed into databases that may be accessed by machine learning models for the development of an AI

## Types of Data Storage in AWS

>[!Definition]
>Given that AWS provides a plethora of services, storage devices are included as one of its main components and resources. Refer to the following to see the types of mediums it offers

| Service                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Use Case                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon S3                   | Object based storage designed for applications that require highly available and scalable storage solutions. The data stored here is not meant to be quickly accessible for instances such as IOT device outputs, rather it is meant for loading static data onto | Data Lakes, Log Storage, Data Pipeline Endpoint, Backup and Archive                                                                                                               |
| Amazon EBS                  | This is a block storage medium provided for EC2 instances given their high performance and persistent storage capabilities. **Block storage means that data is stored in fixed-size chunks known as blocks**, each block has an identifier                        | Relational Database Storage, Application storage, EC2 boot volumes, Container storage (e.g. Docker based application                                                              |

## Apache Spark

>[!Definition]
>Apache spark is an **open source distributed computing engine** that focuses on big data processing and analytics, etc. It is ideal for running complex tasks on the cloud given its distributed computational power, hence its ability to execute these tasks with ease

Spark is a part of the Hadoop ecosystem as it takes care of big data related projects. One of the main features of spark is the fact that it has in-memory computing, hence enabling it to complete complex tasks. 

**Hadoop** is an open source framework for storing and processing large datasets across multiple computer clusters. It has two main components:

- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)** - A distributed file system that stores data across multiple machines
- **MapReduce (Processing Engine)** - A programming model utilized by Hadoop to process data in parallel, it does so by **Mapping** the data (filtering and sorting) and then **Reduces** it (summarizes and shortens)

Spark is a substitute to Hadoops current MapReduce function as it offers to run processes in parallel with the added feature of **in-memory** processing. So, there are some features to consider when utilizing Spark instead of Hadoops map reduce model:

| Feature              | Hadoop / Map Reduce                                                                              | Spark                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Loads           | Batch Processing                                                                                 | Both batch processing and real time processing                        |
| Speeds               | Slower, data takes time to be written                                                            | Much more faster given their in-memory feature                        |
| Optimizations        | Developers are responsible for optimizations                                                     | Spark has an auto optimization feature                                |
| Language             | Java                                                                                             | Scala - Functional                                                    |
| Coding               | Requires several classes for a small task                                                        | Same task can be executed with spark in one to two lines of code      |
| Processing           | There are intermediate result stages if there are multiple map phases                            | In memory processing requires only one stage with underlying segments |
| Iterative Algorithms | Mappers and reducers started and killed per iteration which consumes memory and processing power | Data is saved in memory and executors are stashed to be reused        |

So, these are the basic features and fundamentals of Spark that can offer better performance than Hadoop's MapReduce processor.

>[!important]
>Spark has the added benefit of something called **RDD** (Resilient Distributed Dataset) and in-memory processing

- **RDD** basically stands for a Resilient Distributed Dataset that is a read only set of data that is used to separate data when distributing it into the Spark System
- This is ideal for data lineage reconstruction as it could trace back where the data had originated from by tracing it back to the RDD
- It makes the process of partitioning datasets much easier without having to worry about finding the source of the data as its stored in an immutable dataset
- In-memory processing is a direct contrast that makes Spark computational engine better than Hadoop's "MapReduce" function given that it can cache recently utilized algorithms and run it immediately, etc

## Apache Spark Components

![Pasted image 20250413171504.png](/img/user/pngs/Pasted%20image%2020250413171504.png)

Spark consists of four main components, each of which present a different function:

- **MLlib** - A machine learning library to provide a computational interface to host machine learning models on it
- **Streaming** - Framework to stream real time data into a computational model, ideal for analytics related purposes
- **SQL** - A distributed query engine that provides low latency, interactive queries
- **GraphX** - Graph processing for spark based graphs and similar analytical tools

## Spark Execution Model

>[!Definition]
>Spark utilizes a cluster based architecture as to where it manages multiple sub clusters of machines, each of which execute tasks concurrently. Refer to the following diagram to see how the architecture works

![Pasted image 20250413173159.png](/img/user/pngs/Pasted%20image%2020250413173159.png)

- **Driver Node**:
	- Here is where the main function of the application is carried out, its the central coordinator for the Spark application
	- Once a task has been defined a DAG is created
	- After forming the DAG it is sent into the executor in the worker node
	- Driver nodes consist o:
		- **Spark Sessions** - here is where jobs are submitted and the datasets are fed into
		- **Spark Context** - this is the underlying engine that manages sparks application by connecting the cluster manager, context and worker nodes while tracking job progress
- **Cluster Manager**:
	- This manages which DAG is to be executed from which cluster by specifying it
	- Thereafter the worker node that is to carry out the DAG is specified here as well
	- It assigns executors on **worker nodes** based on the driver’s request which can be one of the following:
	    - **Standalone** (default Spark manager)
	    - **YARN** (Hadoop ecosystem)
	    - **Mesos**
	    - **Kubernetes**
	- Cluster managers help with resource allocations
	- In other words, worker nodes are actual machines in which the specified tasks are carried out in
- **Worker Nodes**:
	- These are actual machines responsible for carrying out the tasks specified by the cluster manager
	- They can store data in-memory for fault tolerance by ensuring that some tasks are cached in case it were to crash

To summarize:

1. A user starts a **Spark Session** on the Driver Node.
    
2. The **Spark Context** communicates with the **Cluster Manager** to request resources.
    
3. The **Cluster Manager** allocates **executors** on available **Worker Nodes**.
    
4. The **Driver** sends **tasks** (small units of work) to executors.
    
5. **Executors execute the tasks**, do computations, and report results back to the Driver.
    
6. Results are collected, cached, or written to storage.
