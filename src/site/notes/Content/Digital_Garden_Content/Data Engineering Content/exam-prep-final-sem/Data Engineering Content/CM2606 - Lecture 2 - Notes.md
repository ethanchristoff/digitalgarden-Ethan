## What is data modelling?

>[!Definition]
>Refers to the process of modelling a visual representation of how data elements are to be interconnected with each other such that their relationships are displayed. This includes storage, and methods in which the model may be accessed

The purpose of data modelling is to develop meaningful relationships amongst data notes within a system, displaying how data is to be structured logically and consistently. Data requirements for a business are pointed out here as well. Refer to the following points to understand the importance of data modelling:

- **Aligning with business needs** - reveals the needs of a business through essential data
- **Enhancing Data Quality** - important for identifying and rectifying inconsistencies and errors in the inputted data while enforcing rules and constraints (e.g. constraint specifying relationship types)
- **Optimizing Data Storage** - minimizes redundant data by overlaying existing columns or rows such that less space is taken, etc
- **Facilitating Data Integration** - ensures sharing and collaboration on systems through the introduction of concurrent access and role based accessed, etc
- **Supports Data Analysis** - through the introduction of a model, data analytics may be introduced to provide detailed reports in a businesses workflow

There are multiple steps to consider in data modelling:

1. **Conceptual Modelling** - Important step for identifying entities, relationships and attributes for entities while being independant of any technical aspects
2. **Logical Modelling** - Entities, attributes and relationships are defined in more detail here by specifying them in more technical (database related) terms
3. **Physical Modelling** - Defining the components required to implementing the logical model through the use of hardware components, etc

Some of the most common modelling techniques include:

- **Entity Relationship Diagrams** - Visual representation of a conceptual model that represent the entities, attributes and their relationships with other entities
- **Data Dictionaries** - Detailed documentations of data elements, inclusive of descriptions defining data types, constraints, etc
