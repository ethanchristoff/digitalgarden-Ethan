## What is Apache Kafka?

>[!Definition]
>Kafka is a data streaming service where data can be produced onto it and consumed from another machine in another end. The data stored in it can be retained for a given period of time before expiring 

Through the use of Kafka you can implement a process known as event streaming, it refers to the process of streaming a real time event from a source onto a platform that proceeds to store it and then retain it until consumed or utilized. The stored data is not manipulated until received or retrieved by a device. 

To generalize how Kafka works:

- It's a distributed system that communicates between servers and clients
- It is deployed in a high performing TCP network which is inclusive of hardware and virtual machines
