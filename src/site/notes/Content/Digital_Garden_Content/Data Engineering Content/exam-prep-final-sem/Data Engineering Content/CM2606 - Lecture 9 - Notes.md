## Why is cloud and big data important for machine learning?

Given that machine learning models get more complex at any given time due to the fact that they tend to stay up to data with trends in order to maintain a more truthful and consistent knowledge base, a storage medium for big data is required. 

Besides that, machine learning models cannot be processed locally on just any laptop given how resource intensive they are, so through the introduction of cloud computing resources the issue of processing power, etc, may be mitigated.

To summarize:

- Big data provides massive datasets
- Bigger datasets lead to more progressive and better ML predictions
- Cloud computing is cheaper and more scalable
- Offers distributed processing 

Through the combination of both cloud resources and big data processing, machine learning models are capable of being run from any place with ease.
