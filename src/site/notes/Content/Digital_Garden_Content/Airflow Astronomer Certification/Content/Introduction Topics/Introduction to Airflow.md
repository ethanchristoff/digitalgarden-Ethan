Some of the reasons airflow became so popular include:

- The fact that its pipelines can be defined by code (mainly python)
- It is community driven and maintained as an open source project with a large community of developers.
- It is very easy to monitor pipelines and understand where and what went wrong through the use of airflow.
- The events scheduled in pipelines are often triggered not only in specific time intervals, but even as a result of a certain even (*similar to aws lambda*).
- It has over a 100 integration packages, hence making it compatible with a lot of ecosystems. etc.
- Some corporations that utilize Airflow include:
	- Walmart (Retail Domain)
	- Fanduel (Finance Domain)
