## Who utilizes Airflow and for what purpose is it used?

>[!Important]
>In most cases Airflow is intended for the use of orchestrating the flow of data within an organization, hence how it may be ideally used by people such as data scientists, engineers, data architects, etc

The following are the main use cases for where data in businesses are critical and important, hence where airflow would be ideal in terms of implementation:

- **Data Powered Applications** - simply refers to applications that rely on data to properly functions (e.g. any type of health tracking application would rely on data to provide metrics, etc)

- **Critical Operational processes** - These refer to important operational processes that are required to happen in order for a business to function (e.g. a a fraud detection system in a banking app).

- **Analytics & Reporting** - This refers to the process of systematically analyzing data to retrieve insights that are important to review, etc. Think of an application based around something like power BI where metrics to present are important.

- **MLOps & AI** - MLOps refer to the process of deploying, integrating and managing machine learning models into operational workflows or in this case, pipelines. Hence where the importance of orchestrating data flows comes again given how you would need to setup methods in which the data is to be pushed into a model, etc.

To conclude which personas may utilize airflow in which kind of use case:

- Data Scientists would be used for research purposes in new domains, such as exploring and pre-processing new datasets
- Data Engineers would utilize tools such as airflow to engineer pipelines, etc
- Machine learning engineers may utilize airflow in order to deploy and create machine learning models that can be managed and deployed in a hosted environment
- Data Analysts would utilize tools as such to productionize sql queries, present data, etc
